### Running FetchData.py
FetchData.py is used to collect data from Reddit. To run this script, do the following:
- replace CLIENT_ID = "CLIENT_ID" with your own Reddit client ID
- replace CLIENT_SECRET = "CLIENT_SECRET" with your own Reddit client secret
- replace USER_AGENT = "Project_Name:1.0 (by u/userName)" with your project name and username

- In SUBREDDITS_TO_SCAN, add the subreddits you want to look in.
- In DISCLAIMERS, add the disclaimers you want to be included in the posts.
- In INFLUENCER_TERMS, add the terms you want to be included in the posts.

- Optional: Edit the COMMENTS_PER_POST_LIMIT and POSTS_PER_SUB to get a different number of posts per sub. Increasing the number will take the script longer to run.
